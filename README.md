# Project Title

Selenium and pytest automation framework. 

## Practice Websites
### Form Handling
This website provides a form with different input fields, 
radio buttons, and a dropdown. Testers can practice automating 
form submissions and verifying validations.

* https://demoqa.com/browser-windows
* https://demoqa.com/alerts
* https://demoqa.com/frames

###  Dynamic Content
This website demonstrates how to handle dynamically loaded 
elements using Selenium. It offers scenarios where elements
appear after a certain delay.

### Web UI
One of the most interesting websties to practice Selenium is 
CandyMapper. This halloween-style demo website is designed to 
find bugs.

### Online shop Simulation
For testers interested in simulating online shop scenarios, the Sauce Labs 
application is an excellent choice. This site mimics an e-commerce portal 
and provides opportunity to automate product selection, shopping cart 
management, and the checkout process. Testers can hone their skills in 
end-to-end user flow automation and complex interactions.

### E-commerce
This is another example of a simple online store, perfect for UI testing.

### Form Handling, UI Design
Formy provides various forms and UI components for practice, helping testers 
master form automation and enhance their UI testing skills.

### Herokuapp â€“ Floating Menu

This demo site focuses on testing floating menus and interactions that involve
scrolling. Testers can work on automating interactions with floating menus and
handling scrolling behavior on web pages. This scenario is particularly useful
for testers who want to explore more advanced user interactions beyond basic 
clicks and inputs.
